	<h1>Design basics</h1>

	<p>Macaw allows for workflow that is similar to that of an image editor. You can draw and move elements freely on the canvas, then style them as you see fit. After that, if good HTML is important to you, you can organize and describe elements in the outline panel. The more Macaw knows about your elements purpose the better code output it will produce.</p>

	<p>What's set's Macaw apart from other design software is it's ability to define elements dimensions both in pixels or percentages.</p>

	<h2>Canvas</h2>

	<p>When scrolling or panning the canvas vertically, all elements with fixed positioning remain in their places relative to the top and bottom canvas borders. Thanks to this smart feature you can see them just like they would behave in the browser.</p>

	<p>Canvas in Macaw is fluid. At any moment you can grab the canvas resize handle on the right-hand-side and check how your design behaves when resized, and after you release the handle - canvas will spring back to its original size. You can permanently change canvas width through the breakpoint area in the Inspector Pane</p>

	<p>In the design phase canvas height adjusts automatically, adding empty space at its bottom, allowing you to have maximum creative freedom. When the document is published - all the excess amount of the canvas is shaved off from the bottom just as the bottom most element ends. <span class="wip">Might need different wording</span></p>

	<h2>The Grid</h2>

	<p>Grid is an essential part of Macaw's workspace and workflow. It helps you to place elements evenly on the page and serves as a guide throughout the whole design process.</p>

	<p>You can set up the grid to match your preferences, using <em>Grid Width</em>, <em>Number of Grid Columns</em> and <em>Space Between Grid Columns</em>. Like many other elements grid width can be set either as in percentages or pixel dimensions.</p>

	<img src="design-basics/img/grid-setting-up.gif" alt="">

	<h2>Drawing</h2>

	<p>Primary way of creating content in Macaw is by drawing. To draw some elements just pick the desired tool from the tool-bar then <strong>click + drag</strong> on the canvas. There are no constraints on where to draw an element, you can draw anywhere on the canvas, including on top of other elements. You can draw text elements, containers, buttons or even form elements. Images can be placed on the canvas right from within the library.</p>

	<p>You can draw elements with percentage (%) or pixel (px) based widths and positions. These can be also adjusted later.</p>
	<img src="design-basics/img/percentage-or-px-based-width-and-x.png" alt="">


	<p>While drawing, elements will snap to grid, smart guides, canvas boundaries or other elements.</p>
	<img src="design-basics/img/drawing-snapping.gif" alt="">

	<h3>Elements</h3>

	<p>Elements can be drawn with the Element Tool <strong>R</strong>, when converted to code they will become block level elements such as divs, sections, forms, etc.</p>

	<h3>Containers</h3>

	<p>Design wise containers are used for grouping other elements, but unlike groups in standard design software, containers have their own dimensions (or even paddings) and can be styled just like standard elements.</p>

	<p>You can create containers by using the Elements > Group command. Another way of creating containers is by using the Container Tool <strong>G</strong>, with it selected simply drag over some elements to wrap them in a container. Groups created with Container Tool will immediately have dimensions based on the area you've dragged over while drawing, whereas grouping with Elements > Group command will adjust the group size to fit it's children.</p>

	<p>If among the elements that you are grouping together with Elements > Group command, one seems to fit the task of containing all the other elements, Macaw will ask you if you want to transfer presentation attributes of that element to the newly created group. In other words: Macaw is smart enough to use existing elements as groups when it makes sense, and leave you with cleaner code in the process.</p>

	<p class="wip">This image could be smaller, need to think how to show it on a smaller crop area.</p>

	<h3>Text</h3>

	<p>Macaw has the advantage of using a browser based canvas, which allows the text to be rendered exactly like it will be in the target browser.</p>

	<h4>Paragraph and Point text fields</h4>

	<p>You can create two types of text boxes in Macaw. Simply clicking on the canvas with the Text Tool selected, will create a Point Text field that has auto width and behaves like an inline element.</p>

	<p>To create a block based text box, that has set dimensions and behaves like a block level element, click and drag on the canvas with Text Tool selected.</p>

	<p>You can also toggle between two types of text boxes after you've created a field, by choosing an adequate value from width field's units in Dimensions section of Inspector Pane. Choosing <strong>Auto</strong> will set the text box to Point Text, whereas <strong>px</strong> or <strong>%</strong> will set the text box to Paragraph Text.</p>

	<h4>Text field dimensions</h4>

	<p>When a text element is selected, resize handles help you identify it's type and properties. If side handles are present, they indicate that element's width is set in px or %. Top and bottom handles indicate that this text element has set height in px or %. Lack of handle pair means that this property is set to auto.</p>
	<img src="design-basics/img/text-selection-boxes.png" alt="">

	<h4>Paragraphs versus line breaks</h4>

	<p>Hitting <strong>Return/Enter</strong> to separate lines of text inside a text box will result in code output for that box being divided into several paragraphs. You can also use <strong>Shift</strong> + <strong>Return/Enter</strong> to create line breaks (&lt;br&gt;) in the code output.</p>

	<h4>Fast text prototyping</h4>

	<p>Macaw supports <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> text generation, for quickly filling text boxes with sample copy. To add generated text to a text box double click the text box, type <strong>loremXp</strong> (where X stands for number of paragraphs you wish to create) then hit <strong>TAB</strong> and Macaw will generate X paragraphs of <em>Lorem Ipsum&hellip;</em>.</p>

	<p>For finer amounts of generated text, you can type <strong>loremXw</strong> instead (where X stands for number of words you wish to add) then hit <strong>Tab</strong> and Macaw will add X words to that text box.</p>

	<p>Both shortcuts can be used multiple times in one text box, to fill it with sample content just as you see fit.</p>

	<img src="design-basics/img/lorem-generator.gif" alt="">


	<h3>Inputs</h3>

	<h4>Buttons</h4>

	<p>Buttons are drawn using the button tool <strong>B</strong>. After clicking &amp; dragging on the canvas, the button stays in edit mode, where you can set it's text. Button text is centered by default.</p>

	<p>If you attach a URL to a button using Link field inside Inspector Pane, the button will redirect to that URL through an <strong>onClick</strong> JavaScript event. To change the button to a standard link, change the button tag name inside Inspector Pane to <strong>a</strong>, it will be then converted to a plain <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> tag in the output.</p>

	<h4>Input text</h4>

	<p>After drawing an input field, you can type some text inside, that will be used as a HTML5 placeholder text for that field.</p>
	<p>For Input text field, in the Inspector Pane, apart from element tag name you can additionally set it's name attribute. You can also choose input type, from various types supported by HTML 5, e.g.: text, email, password, number, search, URL.</p>

	<h4>Text area</h4>

	<p>Just like with Input text, after drawing a Text Area you can set it's text which will be used for HTML5 placeholder text.</p>

	<p>In the Inspector Pane you can set Text area's name attribute and set how it should react to resizing attempts after publishing in the browser.</p>

	<h4>Select</h4>
	<p>Like other form elements, the Select Element can also have it's HTML name attribute set.</p>

	<p>Select supports multiple option elements, you can add, reorder and remove them from within Inspector Pane. First top-most option will be used as the default one.</p>

	<img src="design-basics/img/select-options.gif" alt="">

	<h4>Checkbox &amp; radio</h4>

	<p>Checkbox and radio elements can be drawn by clicking and dragging on the canvas with their respective tools. Both elements have a minimum width of 66 px and minimum height of 22 px, that are applied when drawing, but can be adjusted later.</p>

	<p>When a checkbox or radio element is added to the canvas, it's actually creating two separate elements: checkbox/radio and text field, that are grouped together inside a label (so 3 HTML elements in total):</p>

	<h3>Embeds</h3>

	<h2>Positioning</h2>

	<h3>Positioning types</h3>

	<p>Macaw supports three positioning types: static (default), absolute and fixed. For every element, you can pick which positioning should be used by Macaw.</p>

	<p>To make it easier to identify element positions, element selection boxes, margin indicators and even part of UI that controls the position have colors based on selected element position type. This allows for easy inspection whenever you select an element.</p>

	<p>Following colors are used for marking position type:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Static - Blue,</li>
		<li>Absolute - Orange,</li>
		<li>Fixed - Green.</li>
	</ul>

	<img src="design-basics/img/position-static-absolute-fixed.png" alt="">

	<p><strong>Static positioning</strong> is the default used by Macaw. Elements with static position are placed using their margin values relating to the canvas or other elements. If elements overlap - negative margins may be used.</p>

	<p class="wip">When static positioning is set to a bunch of elements - they might move if you move the element that their margin relates to. (Really unsure if this is a bug or a feature - needs to be verified. Also might need an animation)</p>

	<p><strong>Absolute positioning</strong> allows the elements to be independent of other elements positions. It can also be used to position elements inside their parents.</p>

	<p><strong>Fixed positioning</strong> is useful for elements that have to be fixed (pinned) to the page and stay at their position even if the page is scrolled. This allows you to see their behavior during design phase, just like you would in the browser.</p>

	<p class="wip">needs animation on how pinning looks like in a design when scrolled</p>

	<h3>Origins</h3>

	Origins in Macaw define how an element is placed on the canvas in relation to other elements. It directly translates to how that element's margins are set. For statically positioned elements you have the option to set X origins, whereas absolutely and fixed positioned elements additionally allow you to set Y origins.

	<p>X origin can be set to left, right or center. X center origin means that an element will be always centered inside it's parent, left and right origins will allow an element to be positioned relatively to the desired side of it's parent.</p>

	<p>Y origin can be set to top, bottom or middle. Y middle origin means that an element will be always centered vertically inside it's parent. By combining X center and Y middle origins you can place an element exactly in the middle of it's parent. Top and bottom Y origins position the element in the desired distance either from top or bottom of it's container.</p>

	<p>By using fixed positioning you can easily create <strong>sticky headers and footers</strong> just by adjusting elements position and setting Y origin to top or bottom.</p>

	<h3>Margins</h3>

	<p>Margin indicators (solid semi-transparent blocks that show up on element's sides when it's selected) help to determine how an element will be placed on the canvas with relation to the surrounding elements.</p>

	<p class="wip">top position / margin, can be only set in px</p>


	<h2>Styling</h2>

	<p>Macaw allows you to apply various styles to your elements using the Inspector Pane, with all of the styles translating to appropriate CSS counterparts.</p>

	<p>To set element's styles you need to have that element selected and pick desired styles from the Inspector Pane. Some styles (e.g. border &amp; border radius for standard elements and text styles for text elements) can be applied to multiple elements at the same time. To do that, just hold <strong>SHIFT</strong> and click on desired elements to select them all, then pick their common styles.</p>

	<p>When you create new elements, by default they have some styles applied to them, to make it easier for you to work with them.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Element</strong> - elements have their background color set to gray: rgb(222, 222, 222).</li>
		<li><strong>Text</strong> - font is set to black 16px Helvetica with 1.38em line height and a weight of 400. Paragraph spacing is set to 1em.</li>
		<li><strong>Button</strong> - font is set to black 16px Helvetica with 1.38em line height and a weight of 400. Background color set to rgb(222, 222, 222), with a border radius of 3px.</li>
		<li><strong>Input</strong> - font is set to black 13px Helvetica with 1.38em line height and a weight of 400. Background is set to a lighter gray rgb(242, 242, 242), with left and right paddings set to 10px.</li>
		<li><strong>Text area</strong> - font is set to black 16px Helvetica with 1.38em line height and a weight of 400. Background is set to a lighter gray rgb(242, 242, 242), with all paddings set to 5px and a 1px gray rgb(119, 119, 119) border.</li>
		<li><strong>Select</strong> - font is set to black 13px Helvetica with 1.38em line height and a weight of 400. Background is set to a lighter gray rgb(242, 242, 242), with left padding set to 10px, a 1px gray rgb(119, 119, 119) border and a border radius of 3px. Additionally this element has a SVG background (select-arrows.svg).</li>
		<li><strong>Checkbox and Radio Button</strong> - font is set to black 16px Helvetica with 1.38em line height and a weight of 400.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Backgrounds</h3>

	<p>Macaw allows for setting background colors, images and even setting a gradient background. One element can have multiple background images/gradients applied, that can be managed inside the <strong>Backgrounds</strong> section of Inspector pane.</p>

	<p class="wip">Maybe a screenshot of a typical setup with a couple backgrounds and a bg color.</p>

	<p>Most of elements including the canvas (body) can have their backgrounds set.</p>

	<h4>Background Color</h4>

	<p>Background color can be set through the Background Color value field. Supported values are <strong>HEX</strong> e.g. #0064f0, <strong>RGB</strong> e.g. rgb(0, 100, 240) and <strong>HSL</strong> e.g. hsl(215, 100%, 47%). You can also put <strong>transparent</strong> inside that field and it will get transformed to rgba(0, 0, 0, 0), the same will happen if the value is deleted. Macaw also supports semi-transparent background colors, which can be entered as <strong>RGBA</strong> e.g. rgba(0, 99, 239, 0.52) and <strong>HSLA</strong> e.g. hsla(215, 100%, 47%, 0.52).</p>

	<img src="design-basics/img/background-color-field.png" alt="Background Color Value Field">

	<p>Background colors can be also chosen through the Color Picker dialog, by clicking on the color well near the background color value field. This will launch Macaw's Color Picker dialog in which you can adjust the color and set transparency as well as the type of the outputted value (HEX, RGB(A), HSL(A)).</p>

	<h4>Background Images</h4>

	<p>Background Images can be applied to an element by clicking the <strong>Add Background</strong> button symbolized by the <strong>+</strong> sign in Backgrounds section and choosing <strong>Image…</strong> from the drop-down. All background properties can be set inside Background Image dialog that appears, including position, size, horizontal and vertical repeats and attachment type.</p>

	<p>HiDPI backgrounds can be enabled by clicking the @2x label inside the Background Image dialog.</p>

	<h4>Gradient Backgrounds</h4>
