	<h1>Design basics</h1>

	<p>Macaw allows for workflow that is similar to that of an image editor. You can draw and move elements freely on the canvas, then style them as you see fit. After that, if good HTML is important to you, you can organize and describe elements in the outline panel. The more Macaw knows about your elements purpose the better code output it will produce.</p>

	<h2 class="content-subhead">Drawing</h2>

	<p>Primary way of creating content in Macaw is by drawing. There are no constraints where to draw an element. You can draw text elements, containers, buttons or even form elements. Images can be placed on the canvas right from within the library.</p>

	<p>While drawing, elements will snap to grid and smart guides.</p>

	<p>You can draw elements with percentage or pixel based widths and positions. These can be also adjusted later.</p>

	<h3>Elements</h3>

	<p>Elements can be drawn with the Element Tool <strong>R</strong>, when converted to code they will become block level elements such as divs, sections, forms, etc.</p>

	<h3>Containers</h3>

	<p>Design wise containers are used for grouping other elements, but unlike groups in standard design software, containers have their own dimensions (or even paddings) and can be styled just like standard elements.</p>

	<p>You can create containers simply by using the Elements > Group command or by using the Container Tool <strong>G</strong>. You can simply drag over some elements with Container Tool selected, to wrap these elements in a container.</p>

	<p>Groups created with Container Tool will immediately have dimensions based on the area you've dragged over while drawing</p>

	<p>Groups created with a Container Tool will immediately have dimensions based on the area you've dragged over while drawing, whereas grouping with Elements > Group command will adjust the group size to fit it's children.</p>
