      <h1>Drawing</h1>
      <p>The primary way of creating elements in Macaw is drawing. Macaw allows you to draw numerous types of elements by simply <strong>clicking and dragging</strong> on the canvas.</p>

      <h3>Units</h3>
      <p>You can draw elements with percentage or pixel based widths and positions. The controls for these options appear in the property bar after selecting a drawing tool.</p>
      <img src="design-basics/img/percentage-or-px-based-width-and-x.png" alt="">

      <h3>Snap</h3>
      <p>You can toggle Snap by selecting <strong class="cmd">View > Toggle Snap</strong> or pressing <strong class="key">Cmd+U</strong>. When enabled, your cursor will snap to the grid, canvas boundaries and other elements as you draw.</p>
      <img src="design-basics/img/drawing-snapping.gif" alt="">

      <h3>Drag Origin</h3>
      <p>When drawing an element, hold <strong class="key">Option</strong> to change the element's origin instead of its size.</p>

      <h2>Element Tool (R)</h2>
      <p>The Element Tool is the most primitive of the drawing tools. It creates empty elements with no content. They can be useful for rapid prototyping or initial styling. However, it's recommended that these elements eventually be converted into containers.</p>

      <h2>Container Tool (G)</h2>
      <p>Containers are used for grouping elements. However, containers are not like groups in standard image editing software. They have their own dimensions and can be styled like other elements.</p>

      <p>To create a container using the Container Tool, simple click and drag on the canvas. As the area of the container expands, it will highlight any elements it covers. Highlighted elements will be placed inside the newly drawn container.</p>

      <p>You can also create containers by selecting an array of elements and using the <strong class="cmd">Elements > Group</strong> command or <strong class="key">Cmd-G</strong>. Groups created in this way will automatically set the group dimensions to fit the boundaries of the children.</p>

      <p>Note: If the bottommost element being grouped surrounds all of the other elements, Macaw will ask if you would like to transfer presentation attributes to the new container. This will basically place everything inside the larger element. It is highly recommended that you do so as it typically results in cleaner and more semantic markup.</p>
      <img src="design-basics/img/transfering-presentation-attributes.gif" alt="">

      <h2>Text Tool (T)</h2>

      <p>Macaw's canvas is actually a web browser, so it can render text exactly how it will appear on the web. It can also tie in to popular font services like Typekit.</p>

      <h3>Paragraph and Point Text</h3>
      <p>There are two types of text elements in Macaw: point text and paragraph text. Simply clicking on the canvas with the Text Tool, will create a Point Text field that has auto width and behaves like an inline element. Paragraph Text, which has set dimensions and behaves like a block level element, can be created by clicking and dragging on the canvas with the Text Tool.</p>

      <p>You can toggle between the two types of text boxes, by changing the element's width suffix in the Dimensions Palette. Choosing <strong>Auto</strong> will set the element to Point Text, whereas <strong>px</strong> or <strong>%</strong> will set the element to Paragraph Text.</p>

      <h3>Dimensions</h3>
      <p>When a text element is selected, resize handles help you identify it's type and properties. If side handles are present, they indicate that an element's width is set in px or %. Top and bottom handles indicate that this text element has a height set in px or %. Lack of handles show that width or height is set to auto.</p>
      <img src="design-basics/img/text-selection-boxes.png" alt="">

      <h3>Paragraphs versus line breaks</h3>
      <p>Hitting <strong class="key">Return</strong> to separate lines of text inside a text box will result in code output for that box being divided into several paragraphs. You can also use <strong class="key">Shift-Return</strong> to create line breaks (&lt;br&gt;) in the code output.</p>

      <h3>Lorem Insertion</h3>
      <p>Macaw supports <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> text generation, for quickly filling text elements with dummy text. Simply type <strong class="key">loremXY</strong> and press <strong class="key">TAB</strong>. In this shortcut, Y must be set to either 'w' for words, 's' for sentences or 'p' for paragraphs. X must be an integer indicating the number of Y to inser. For example, <strong class="key">lorem3p</strong> would insert three paragraphs and <strong class="key">lorem2s</strong> would insert two sentences.</p>
      <img src="design-basics/img/lorem-generator.gif" alt="">

      <h2>Input Tool (N)</h2>
      <p>Text, email, password, number, search and url input elements can all be drawn using the Input Tool. By default, Macaw will draw a standard text input. You can change the input type using the Type dropdown in the inspector. Note: changing the input type is not immediately noticeable within Macaw. However, the type attribute will be set when published.</p>
      <p>Input fields are text editable. Any text you put inside the element will be used as placeholder text when published.</p>

      <h2>Button Tool (B)</h2>
      <p>Buttons are similar to text elements, but they automatically center their text vertically. They also have a special property called "type" (editable in the advanced palette) which allows them to handle things like form submission.</p>
      <p>Note: if using a button for a simple link, you may want to convert the button to an "a" tag. This can be done by renaming the element (<strong class="key">Cmd-R</strong>) to "a.button-name". This may cause some unwanted style changes, but will create a more standards-adherent link.</p>

      <h2>Textarea (Shift-N)</h2>
      <p>Textarea elements are much like input elements, but they allow for larger working areas. The textarea's name attribute and resize setting can be set in the inspector.</p>

      <h2>Select (Shift-N)</h2>
      <p>The select element is basically a dropdown. You can modify the available options for the select, using the list builder in the Inspector. You can add an option by clicking the <strong class="btn">+</strong> button. Double-clicking the option name allows you to edit the text. Click and drag an option to rearrange it and click the trash icon to delete it. Note: the first option will be used as the default.</p>
      <img src="design-basics/img/select-options.gif" alt="">

      <h2>Checkbox &amp; Radio (Shift-N)</h2>
      <p>Checkbox and radio elements can be drawn by clicking and dragging on the canvas with their respective tools. Both elements have a minimum width of 66 px and minimum height of 22 px, that are applied when drawing, but can be adjusted later.</p>
      <p>When a checkbox or radio element is added to the canvas, three elements are actually created: a checkbox or radio, a label and a container for them both.</p>
      <img src="design-basics/img/radio-checkbox-structure.gif" alt="">
    </section>

    <section id="positioning">
      <h1>Positioning</h1>

      <p>Macaw allows three types of positioning: static (default), absolute and fixed. Each of these mechanisms has its own uses and limitations. Every element within Macaw can have its own type of positioning.</p>

      <p>Positioning modes can be set using the three icons on the left of the property bar, which are visible when an element is selected. The wave icon is used for static, the crosshair is for absolute and the pin is for fixed positioning.</p>

      <h2>Static</h2>
      <p>Static is the default positioning mode of Macaw. Elements set to static are positioned in relation to the element that precedes it in the document. This can be somewhat confusing to someone unfamiliar with web development, however it's very important to wrap your head around as most of the web is constructed using these mechanics.</p>

      <p>Margins are the properties used to set the distance between an element and the one before it. When dragging and element arund the canvas, Macaw will automatically calculate the margins necessary to position the element. You can also use the margin controls in the property bar for fine-tuning.</p>

      <p>Note: Elements using static positioning are essentially chained together. Therefore, modifying properties of one element may affect the positioning of other elements.</p>

      <h2>Absolute</h2>
      <p>Absolute positioning allows elements to be placed at a specific coordinate, which is relative to its parent's coordinates. Elements set to absolute are not in the document flow and, therefore, do not affect the position of the elements around it.</p>

      <h2>Fixed</h2>
      <p>Fixed positioning is similar to absolute positioning except that the coordinates set for fixed elements are relative to the viewport instead of the element's parent. So, elements with fixed positioning will stay in place as the document is scrolled.</p>
      <img src="design-basics/img/position-static-absolute-fixed.png" alt="">

      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>Origins define the direction in which an element is positioned. The options are fairly self-explanatory, but they translate to different properties based on the positioning mode.</p>

      <p>Elements with static positioning allow x-origins to be changed to left, right or center. Left origins will use margin-left to position an element. Right origins will float an element to the right and utilize margin-right for positioning. Center origins will force an element to center using <code>auto</code> for <code>margin-left</code> and <code>margin-right</code>.</p>

      <p>Elements with absolute or fixed positioning have x and y origin controls. Left and right x-origins will publish as left and right properties. Center x-origins will publish as <code>left: 0; right: 0; margin-top: auto; margin-bottom: auto;</code>. Y-origins will use top and bottom properties and center y-origins will publish as <code>top: 0; bottom: 0; margin-top: auto; margin-botton: auto;</code>.</p>

      <h2>Guides</h2>
      <p>Macaw provides on-canvas positioning guides to help you position an element precisely how you want it. Positioning guides change color to identify the positioning mode used: blue is for static, orange is for absolute and green is for fixed.</p>

      <p>Positioning guides appear when dragging or selecting an element. If they do not appear, they may have been toggled off. They can be toggled back on using <strong class="cmd">View > Toggle Positioning Guides</strong> or <strong class="key">Cmd-'</strong>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="properties">
      <h1>Properties</h1>

      <h2>Backgrounds</h2>
      <p>Macaw allows you to add both image and gradient backgrounds to elements and the canvas. You can add as many backgrounds as you like.</p>

      <h3>Adding</h3>
      <p>To add a background, click the <strong class="btn">+</strong> button in the Backgrounds Palette and select the type of background you wish to add.</p>

      <h3>Deleting</h3>
      <p>To delete a background click on the trashcan button or right-click on the background and select <strong class="cmd">Delete</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Images</h3>
      <p>Within the image background dialog you can select to import a new image to use for your background or you can pick an existing image from your library.

      <h3>Gradient</h3>
      <p>To edit a background, double click on the background you wish to edit in the inspector or right-click and select <strong class="cmd">Edit</strong>.</p>
  

      Shadows:
    - Adding shadows
      - Within Macaw you can add drop, inner and text shadows to your elements. To add a shadow select the element you wish to add the shadow to and click the add shadow button. Select the type of shadow you wish to add from the menu.
    - Editing shadows
      - To edit a shadow just double click on corresponding shadow layer in the inspector or right click on it and select "Edit".
    - Deleting shadows
      - To delete a shadow you can click the shadows trashcan icon or you can right click and select the "Delete" option.

        - Styling Text
      - To style your text select the text elements you wish to update and use the text formatting palette in the inspector. All the CSS properties regarding text can be updated for reach text element.
      ** Note: Text styles can only be applied to the entire text element at this time.
    - Type Stats
      - Macaw helps designers keep track of pesky little character counts and characters per line right in the interface. Simply select a text element to see its stats.
    - Adding Typekit Fonts
      - Macaw allows you to easily pull in your favorite Typekit fonts directly in the interface. To include Typekit fonts in your project open the font family dropdown and click the "Add Fonts" text. In the dialog that opens type in your a Typekit kit ID. Once entered Macaw will notify you if the import worked. Your Typekit fonts will now be included in the font dropdown. They will be labeled with a Typekit logo next to each one.
      - Important: To enable Macaw access to your Typekit kit you will need to add 'localhost' as an allowed domain. This can be done on the Typekit website.
    - Using System Fonts
      - Macaw allows you to use all of your system fonts in your designs. By default they are hidden in the font family dropdown. To enable system fonts open the font family dropdown and click the "Show System Fonts" text in the top right. This will load in and include all your system fonts in the font list.
      - Important: System fonts will only work when editing and viewing your design locally. They will not work when uploaded to a server unless the necessary steps are taken.




LINKS
      <p>If you attach a URL to a button using Link field inside Inspector Pane, the button will redirect to that URL through an <strong>onClick</strong> JavaScript event. To change the button to a standard link, change the button tag name inside Inspector Pane to <strong>a</strong>, it will be then converted to a plain <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> tag in the output.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="images">
      <h1>Images</h1>

      <h2>Adding Images</h2>
      <p>Images can be added to your project in three ways. Import to library, import to canvas and dragging images into Macaw.</p>

      <h3>Import to Library</h3>
      <p>Importing images to your library allows you to move images into your Macaw project for later use. Once images are imported into your library you can drag them onto the canvas.</p>
      <p>To import images to your library you can go to <strong class="key">File > Import to Library</strong> or use the keyboard shortcut <strong class="key">Shift+⌘+I (Mac)</strong> / <strong class="key">Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows)</strong>. Multiple images can be imported simultaneously.</p>

      <h3>Import to Canvas</h3>
      <p>Import to canvas performs the same way as "Import to Library" but in addition to adding all the images to your library they will also be added to the canvas.</p>
      <p>To import to canvas you can go to <strong class="key">File > Import to Canvas</strong> or use the keyboard shortcut <strong class="key">⌘+I (Mac)</strong> / <strong class="key">Ctrl+I (Windows)</strong>. Multiple images can be imported simultaneously.</p>

      <h3>Drag Import</h3>
      <p>Images can also be imported directly to the canvas by dragging files from a folder outside of Macaw onto the canvas. This performs like "Import to Canvas" where all images will be both added to your library and to the current canvas.</p>

      <h2>Scaling Images</h2>
      <p>Images by default will always have a height of "auto" and will preserve their proportions on transform or width change. To change an images width and height independently see "Cropping Images" below.</p>

      <h2>Retina Images</h2>
      <o>Macaw makes toggling images to retina dimensions with a single button click. Any image can be toggled using the <strong class="btn">@2x</strong> button in the images palette.</p>
      <p>Note: On retina enabled devices, images on the canvas and images used for backgrounds will be imported with the <strong class="btn">@2x</strong> enabled by default.</p>
      <img src="images/images-retina.png" class="img-images-retina">

      <h2>Generating Optimized Images</h2>
      <p>Macaw makes available the ability to generate optimized images. What this does is on project publish Macaw will analyze all the images in your project and generate new images based on their dimensions. It will also generate regular and @2x retina images as well. The benefit of this is to ensure that your finished project will not contain unnecessarily large images. Instead it will have images at exactly the size it needs so that you site will download as quick as possible.</p>

      <p>"Generate Optimized Images" can be enabled in the "Publish Settings" dialog under the "Images" section.</p>
      <img src="images/images-generate.png" class="img-images-generate">

      <h2>Cropping Images</h2>
      <p>Macaw allows you to crop individual instances of images. This allows you to dynamically generate differently proportioned images from a single image inside your project. Images can also be cropped per breakpoint.</p>
      <p>Note: To be able to crop images in your project you must enable "Generate Optimized Images" your project's publish settings under the "Images" section. It can also be enabled by double clicking on an image. Macaw will prompt you and ask if you would like to enable it.</p>

      <h3>Perform Image Crop</h3>
      <p>To begin cropping an image element double click it on the canvas. This will enter image crop mode and additional transform handles will become available. Within crop mode you can scale the image inside it frame using the transform handles at each corner of the image, you can drag the image to move the image inside its frame (as long as the frame is smaller than the image's dimensions) and you can scale the frames width and height using the frame handles at the top, right, bottom and left sides of the frame. Images can be cropped multiple times. In the event you want to reset an image crop to the original image use the image <strong class="btn">Reset</strong> button. See "Resetting Images" below.</p>

      <h3>Committing Image Crop</h3>
      <p>Once an image has been cropped to the desire dimensions you can leave image crop mode by double clicking anywhere outside of the image. This will apply the changes that were made and the new updated image will be generated.</p>

      <h3>Cancel Image Crop</h3>
      <p>Anytime during image cropping all changes can be reverted by hitting <strong class="key">ESC</strong>. This will rollback the image to what it was when image crop started and exit image crop mode.</p>

      <p>Example:</p>

      <p>Image before crop</p>
      <img src="images/images-crop-before.png" class="img-images-crop-before">

      <p>Image crop mode enabled.</p>
      <img src="images/images-crop-start.png" class="img-images-crop-start">

      <p>Image scale, position and frame adjusted.</p>
      <img src="images/images-crop-edit.png" class="img-images-crop-edit">

      <p>Finished image after crop.</p>
      <img src="images/images-crop-done.png" class="img-images-crop-done">

      <h2>Resetting Images</h2>
      <p>Any images that have been scaled, toggled to retina or cropped can be reset at any time to their original settings using the <strong class="btn">Reset</strong> button in the image palette. This reset will only affect the image's settings at the current breakpoint.</p>
      <img src="images/images-reset.png" class="img-images-reset">

      <h2>Responsive Images</h2>
      <p>By default images can be scaled and toggled to retina per breakpoint. When "Generate Optimized Images" is enabled images can also be cropped per breakpoint. Each of these topics have been discussed up above. When "Generate Optimized Images" is toggled on Macaw will include the "rimages.js" file with your published project files in the js folder. This library handles the swapping out of images both for retina and across breakpoints. All of the image's settings for this library are applied to the images tag via data attributes.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="canvas">
      <h1>Canvas</h1>
      <p>The canvas in Macaw is not a fixed size like in other image editors. It's fluid like a browser window and can be resized at any moment using the resize handle located on the right side of the canvas. This allows you to see how your design behaves at different viewport widths. The height of the canvas is also dynamic. It grows as you add elements to the page – always giving you room to work.</p>

      <h2>Scrolling</h2>
      <p>Horizontal scrolling move the entire viewport left or right for easier manipulation of elements. Scrolling the canvas vertically, however, scrolls the content of the viewport. This allows you to see the effects of fixed positioning.</p>

      <h2>Hand Tool (H)</h2>
      <p>In addition to scrolling the canvas, you can use the Hand Tool to grab and drag it. When using the Hand Tool, a navigator thumbnail will appear in the upper-right corner of the viewport to show the currently visible area. Click anywhere on the navigator to jump to a section in your document.</p>
      <img src="images/navigator.gif" class="img-navigator">

      <h2>Adding Breakpoints</h2>
      <p>You can click and drag the resize handle on the right side of the canvas to watch your designs flow at different viewport sizes. While dragging, a tooltip will appear above the handle to indicate the current width of the canvas. Pressing <strong class="key">Cmd</strong> while dragging allows you to insert a breakpoint at the current width. Breakpoints can also be added using the "+" button in the Breakpoints Palette.</p>

      <h2>Changing Breakpoints</h2>
      <p>You can quickly jump to a viewport size by clicking the appropriate link in the Breakpoints Palette. There are also some useful keyboard shortcuts: <strong class="key">Cmd-[</strong> will move down one breakpoint, <strong class="key">Cmd-]</strong> will move up one breakpoint and <strong class="key">Cmd-\</strong> will toggle between the current breakpoint and the default breakpoint.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="grid">
      <h1>The Grid</h1>

      <p>The grid is an essential part of Macaw's workspace and design workflow. It helps place elements evenly on the page and serves as a guide throughout the design process. The Grid Palette allows you to set the grid to match your preferences. Note: grid settings can be changed per breakpoint.</p>

      <h3>Grid Width</h3>
      <p>This sets the width of the entire grid. It can be set in either pixels or percentages to create static or fluid grids.</p>

      <h3>Columns</h3>
      <p>This is the total number of columns in your grid. The widths of the columns will be automatically calculated.</p>

      <h3>Gutter</h3>
      <p>This is the space between grid columns. It is always set in percentages.</p>
      <img src="design-basics/img/grid-setting-up.gif" alt="">
    </section>

    <section id="components">
      <h1>Components</h1>
      <p>Components are structured groups of elements that can be reused throughout your project. They live in the Library of your project and can be retrieved there on any page.</p>

      <h2>Creating Components</h2>
      <p>o create a component, select the elements that will make up the component and use the command <strong class="cmd">Element > Create Component</strong> or <strong class="key">⌘+K / Ctrl+K</strong>. You will be asked to name the new component after which the component will become available in your library. You can then create a new instance of the component by dragging it from the library to the canvas.</p>

      <p>Note: The name you give Macaw will be used only for reference within the library. It will not affect the markup in any way.</p>
      <img src="images/components.gif" class="img-components">
    </section>

    <section id="global-styles">
      <h1>Global Styles</h1>
      <p>Global styles are a defined set of properties that can be applied to multiple elements at a time. A single element can also have multiple styles applied to it. Any change to a global style will automatically update all elements that haven't overwritten that changing property.</p>

      <p>Global styles are managed via the "Quick Styles" tool which is located in the bottom left corner of the main application window.</p>
      <img src="images/quick-styles.png" class="img-quick-styles">

      <p>When a project has styles all available styles will be listed in the Quick Styles tool. Any applied styles (assuming there are elements selected) will be at the top with a dark grey background. All other styles will be listed below.</p>
      <img src="images/quick-styles-display.png" class="img-quick-styles-display">

      <h2>Creating a Global Style</h2>
      <p>To create a global style open the Quick Styles tool and click the grey <strong class="btn">+</strong> button. The style dialog will open. Inside the style dialog you can set the style's name, see how many elements it is applied to and edit it's properties. By default all properties are toggled off and greyed out. To add properties to the style click the circle next to each property. Once toggled on, property inputs will become enabled.</p>
      <img src="images/global-style-property.png" class="img-global-style-property">

      <h2>Creating a Global Style from an Element</h2>
      <p>Global styles can be created from an existing element in your project. To do this simply select the element on the canvas and then create a style like normal using the grey <strong class="btn">+</strong> button in the Quick Styles tool. When you create a style from an element the style will be pre-populated with all the visual properties on that element. Properties can still be toggled on/off.</p>
      <p><strong>Note: When a global style is created from an element the style will be automatically applied to the originating element.</strong></p>

      <h2>Deleting a Global Style</h2>
      <p>To delete a global style open the Quick Styles tool and right click on the style you wish to delete and hit "Delete Style". This will delete the style and break all element references it has.<p>
      <img src="images/quick-styles-delete.png" class="img-quick-styles-delete">

      <h2>Applying Styles to Elements</h2>
      <p>To add a style to an element select the elements you want to add the style to and click the <strong class="btn">+</strong> icon to the left of the style name in the Quick Styles tool.</p>
      <p>When a style is added it will apply all of the properties that make up that style to the element. Overwriting any values that the elements have.</p>

      <h2>Removing Styles from Elements</h2>
      <p>To remove a style select the elements you want to remove the style from and click the styles corresponding <strong class="btn">x</strong> button. This will break the link between the style and elements.</p>
      <p><strong>Note: When a style is removed from an element only the reference between the style and the element is removed. The element's visual properties will stay exactly the same.</strong></p>

      <h2>Modifying Styles</h2>
      <p>To modify a style open the Quick Styles Tool and double click on the style you wish to update. The style dialog will open and you will be able to make changes to that style.</p>
      <p>All changes to a style will be reflected on all elements it is applied as long as the element's property value matches what was in the style before the change.</p>

      <h2>Syncing Styles with Elements</h2>
      <p>Sometimes a global style and an element may fall out of sync. This occurs when the style's properties do not match the elements properties one-to-one. Out of sync styles are displayed in the Quick Styles tool with the words "(modified)" next to them when you have elements selected.</p>
      <img src="images/quick-styles-modified.png" class="img-quick-styles-modified">
      <p>In the event you want to fully re-apply a global style's properties onto an element you can hit the refresh button (circular arrow) next to the style's name. This is apply all the styles properties to the selected elements overwriting all values on the elements.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="library">
      <h1>Library</h1>
      <p>The library contains all assets and components in your Macaw project. It can be displayed by clicking the <strong class="btn">Library</strong> button in the top right section of the application.</p>

      <p>The library interface has a preview area that will display the current selected item, an import button for importing images (See "Images" section up above), a search bar for quickly finding items in your project and the item list. The item list is seperated into two groups. "Components" and "Project". The "Components" folder contains all components created within the project. The "Project" folder contains all the images that have been imported into your project.</p>

      <h2>Previewing Items in Library</h2>
      <p>To Preview any item in the library click on the item to select it. On selection the preview window at the top of the library will display what the item looks like. This works for both components and images.</p>

      <h2>Placing Library Items on the Canvas</h2>
      <p>Any item in your project's library can be added in the canvas by dragging the item from the library list, moving it onto the canvas where you want it and releasing your mouse button. On drag a preview box will be displayed showing you the dimensions of the item you are placing. The newly placed item will be added on the canvas and placed inside any container that currently has focus. See "Diving into Containers" for more info.</p>

      <h2>Deleting Items</h2>
      <p>Library items can be removed at any time by clicking on the <strong class="btn">Trashcan</strong> icon for any item. On click you will be prompted to confirm that you would like to delete the selected item. IMPORTANT: This action cannot be undone. Tread carefully.</p>
